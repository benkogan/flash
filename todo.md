TODO
====

- PHONY types (e.g. tags) in card spec; use vars instead of hard-coding to search by them
    - also do this for unit / nesting structure?
- make so different sides can be defined in definition, not just forwards / backwards

Card commands
-------------

- `z`: undo
- `h` or `?`: show help overlay
- handle editing a card (and writing to card file)?
